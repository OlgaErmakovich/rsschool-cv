             <li>I try to make the world better, that's why I want to become a front-end developer :) <br>
                I really like to understand how everything is working and try to create something by my own. <br>
                I've been working in IT-sphere for 7 years, but in a little different field. I've worked as an accountant for 5 years, then I've been working as a financial controller for 2 year. 
                In my work I spend a lot of time on testing and creating tasks for programmers. I decided to replace finance with software development because I want to try something new and I'm sure, 
                that I'll enjoy it. <br> I hope, that my new knowledge in HTML and JavaScript can help me achieve my goals. I have a lot of motivation to learn programming languages and I believe, that 
                RS School will be my first step to my new professional sphere. <br>
                My personal qualities as attentiveness, diligence, self-discipline and sense of beauty are the most suitable for front-end developer.  </li>
             <li> I have basic skills in html, JavaScript, know how to use Git as a version control instrument. I am interested in all kinds of front-end technologies. </li>
             <li> </li>
             <li > Will be added later </li>
             <li> I graduated from Belarus State Economic University with Master Degree, studied software testing by myself, and took part in business analysis courses. Now I learning html by using 
                web-sites as <a href="https://htmlacademy.ru"> https://htmlacademy.ru </a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> https://www.w3schools.com/</a>  and reading books about javascript-coding.
                Also I spend a lot of time on self-education by watching tutorial videos.</li>
             <li> I have intermediate English level. I have finished Streamline English courses 5 years ago, and now I'm learning English in Moonlight English School. 
                <br>I have good reading and listening skills, and now I raising my speaking and writing levels.</lo>
