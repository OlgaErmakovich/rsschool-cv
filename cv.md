3. I try to make the world better, that's why I want to become a front-end developer :) I really like to understand how everything is working and try to create something by my own. 
I've been working in IT-sphere for 7 years, but in a little different field. I've worked as an accountant for 5 years, then I've been working as a financial controller for 2 year. 
In my work I spend a lot of time on testing and creating tasks for programmers. I decided to replace finance with software development because I want to try something new and I'm sure, 
that I'll enjoy it. I hope, that my new knowledge in html and JavaScript can help me achieve my goals. I have a lot of motivation to learn programming languages and I believe, that 
RS School will be my first step to my new professional sphere.
My personal qualities as attentiveness, diligence, self-discipline and sense of beauty are the most suitable for front-end developer. 
4. I have basic skills in html, JavaScript, know how to use Git as a version control instrument. I am interested in all kinds of front-end technologies.
